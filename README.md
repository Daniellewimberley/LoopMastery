# LoopMastery â€“ Interactive Math & String Utility Program

This project is a C++ console application built to practice and demonstrate different types of loop structures. The program features a simple interactive menu that lets users choose from several math and string-based tools. It runs in a loop, so the user can keep picking options until they decide to exit.

WHAT IT DOES

The program includes the following features:

1. **Factorial Calculator**  
   Calculates the factorial of a number using a 'while' loop.

2. **Number Pyramid**  
   Displays a pyramid-style number pattern using nested 'for' loops.

3. **Sum of Even or Odd Numbers**  
   Lets the user pick whether to sum even or odd numbers up to a given limit, using a 'do-while' loop.

4. **Reverse a String**  
   Reverses any string the user inputs using a 'while' loop.

5. **Exit Program**  
   Ends the program and prints a goodbye message.

HOW TO RUN
